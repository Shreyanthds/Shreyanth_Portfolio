Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for image classification and calorie detection.
This Python script is a Streamlit web application for detecting and classifying fruits and vegetables and fetching their calorie information. It uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images as either fruits or vegetables and provides real-time calorie data for the recognized item. The script is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to upload images and get instant predictions and nutrition information.

## SmartHire.AI (Employee Skill Evaluation for Optimal Job Fit)**

Compares job descriptions with uploaded PDF resumes using NLP techniques.
Calculates similarity and provides a suitability overview.It helps candidates assess how well their resume matches a given job description using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The application takes the job description as input and allows users to upload their resume in PDF format. It then calculates the similarity between the job description and the resume and provides an overview and suitability evaluation based on the similarity score.

In the 'Mercedes Benz Car Data Analytics' Tableau project, we explore valuable insights into Mercedes Benz automatic transmission pricing. We delve into the average prices, taxes, and tax comparisons across models. Additionally, we identify the top 10 engine sizes in Mercedes Benz car models and compare the pricing of diesel, hybrid, and petrol cars. The project also analyzes the differences in average miles per gallon (mpg) between automatic and manual transmissions. Furthermore, we pinpoint the most affordable and economical car models while providing details on the most expensive models and their specifications. All analyses are conducted using an open-source dataset.
