  Hi there, I'm an aspiring data science enthusiast who loves finding patterns and connecting dots â€” 
  be it ideas from different industries, people from diverse backgrounds and teams, or applications from various domains. 
  I have a strong foundation in databases, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. 
  My academic background blends mathematics, engineering, and statistics to drive innovation and practical problem-solving.

  As a researcher, I focus on optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource environments. 
  My recent work includes SCALE: an adaptive adapter injection framework for transformer-based models, 
  enabling memory-efficient fine-tuning. I also work on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Edge AI for real-time inference, 
  and visual recognition systems using YOLOv12 and ViT backbones. These projects aim to bridge the gap between theoretical AI capabilities 
  and their real-world deployment on constrained hardware.
